# ðŸš€ Displaygram PWA Rollout Plan

This document outlines the steps to transition Displaygram.com from a standard React web app into a full **Progressive Web App (PWA)** â€” focusing on *offline resilience, installability, and performance* without disrupting rapid development.

## ðŸ§­ Stage 1 â€” Pre-PWA (Current Development)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Stabilize core business features before introducing caching and service worker complexity.

### âœ… Tasks
- [ ] Finalize **Billing System** (Braintree + Firestore sync)
- [ ] Finish **Company Onboarding Flow** (accounts + products upload)
- [ ] Implement **Supplier Sharing** (sharedWith logic + visibility rules)
- [ ] Add optional **Google Maps Account Creation**
- [ ] Begin planning for **Product/Brand detection** (API or Firebase ML)

### ðŸ’¡ Notes
At this stage, Displaygram is deployed as a normal SPA:
- Users always load the newest code.
- No service worker or caching yet.
- Perfect for rapid iteration and daily deploys.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Lay groundwork for future PWA enablement without activating caching behavior yet.
