# Displaygram.com - Instant Retail Image Archiving and Tracking

## Description

Displaygram.com is a collaborative platform for sales teams, suppliers, and distributors to capture, archive, and share retail display images. It enables companies to create and manage goals for specific stores, allowing team members to submit posts tied to those goals. Suppliers can view posts from connected distributors for shared brands in their portfolio, with robust role-based permissions ensuring each user sees only the relevant data. The platform supports dynamic account management, goal importing (e.g., Gallo API), and company-specific user onboarding to make field execution visible across an entire network.  Suppliers can view posts from connected distributors for shared brands in their portfolio, with robust role-based permissions ensuring each user sees only the relevant data. Team members and partners can also provide direct feedback and start discussions on individual displays, helping capture not only the ‘what’ but also the ‘why’ of execution.

- redesign how companies and users are created.  Rethink how new users and companies join.  
- Build a supplier side dashboard.  Allow suppliers to view posts from connected distributors that post brands they both have in  their portfolio.
- Rename gallo goals and all related logic to something more generic but specific to allow goals to be imported from else where. Integration importing goals....
