## 🔹 1. accounts with multiple sales people

a goal created for an account gets will show one ore more as available for the goal.  i need to show affected sales people for each account and allow a goal creator to choose both or only one sales person
so i probably need a new goal shape.  not going to be thrilled about possibly migrating old goals to fit this shape.  but a goal should have an array of assignments instead of just an array 
of account numbers.  where an assignment now should be an account number with an array of user ids.  typically it would just be one.. but at least now it gives a goal creator the option to choose.
