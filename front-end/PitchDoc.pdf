# Displaygram: Investor Opportunity Brief

## 🚀 What is Displaygram?

Displaygram is a modern web platform built for distributors and suppliers in the beverage industry to capture, archive, and share retail display photos. It empowers sales teams to track in-store execution and enables suppliers to view real-time activity for their brands across a distributor's footprint.

Think of it as a lightweight, photo-first alternative to GoSpotCheck or Encompass — with a focus on speed, ease of use, and supplier visibility.

## 🌟 Why It Matters
